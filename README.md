**Key conventions**

- The `domain` layer has zero Android dependencies (pure Kotlin)
- Exactly one source is active at a time; switching sources triggers a global data refresh
- Cached data is isolated per source (`sourceId`), so sources never pollute each other

- This app only provides playback functionality and bundles no channel or content sources
- Ensure the IPTV sources you use are properly licensed
- Use it in compliance with your local laws and regulations
